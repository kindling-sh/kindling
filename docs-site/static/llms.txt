# kindling

> A Kubernetes operator that turns your laptop into a personal CI/CD environment. Push code, build locally, deploy instantly — with real GitHub Actions runners, 15 auto-provisioned dependencies, and zero cloud costs.

kindling runs a Kind cluster on your Mac or Linux machine. It registers self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, builds container images with Kaniko, and deploys applications using a custom Kubernetes operator. Every `git push` triggers a local build-and-deploy cycle identical to what you'd get from a cloud CI system.

## Key Concepts

- **Kind cluster**: Local Kubernetes via Kind with ingress-nginx, in-cluster registry, and the kindling operator
- **DevStagingEnvironment (DSE)**: Custom resource that declares an app + backing services; operator reconciles Deployment, Service, Ingress, and dependencies
- **GithubActionRunnerPool**: Custom resource that registers self-hosted GitHub Actions runners bound to a repo
- **Kaniko build-agent**: Sidecar in runner pods that builds container images via signal-file protocol
- **15 dependency types**: postgres, redis, mysql, mongodb, rabbitmq, minio, elasticsearch, kafka, nats, memcached, cassandra, consul, vault, influxdb, jaeger — all auto-provisioned with connection URL injection
- **kindling generate**: AI-powered workflow generation using OpenAI or Anthropic; scans Dockerfiles, docker-compose, Helm charts, source code
- **kindling sync**: Live file sync with language-aware restart strategies (wrapper+kill, signal reload, auto-reload, local build+binary sync)
- **kindling secrets**: Kubernetes Secrets with local backup file; survives cluster rebuilds via `kindling secrets restore`
- **kindling expose**: Public HTTPS tunnels via cloudflared or ngrok for OAuth callbacks

## Installation

```bash
brew install kindling-sh/tap/kindling
```
